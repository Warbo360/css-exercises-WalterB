.p {
    background-color: #eb34cc;
    font-family: Verdana, "DejaVu Sans", sans-serif; 
}
#num2 {
    color: #3437eb;
    font-size: 36px;
}
.num3 {
    font-size: 24px;
}
#num4 {background-color: #34eb77;
    font-size: 24px;
    font-weight: bold;
}

/* compared to the solutions.css file I could of saved on typing redundant code by just adding the .num3 class in addition to the #num4 id selector since they are the same attribute thus preventing me from writing "font-size: 24px" twice. Everything else in principal was correct though.
